# StockDetailScreen - Session 2: Complete Implementation

## Status
Starting complete implementation to match web app exactly.

## Approach
Building the complete StockDetailScreen with all sections in one session:
1. Stock chart with time range selector
2. Key statistics section
3. Events timeline (upcoming/past toggle)
4. Company information
5. Ownership data
6. Executives/Board
7. Financials section

## Implementation Plan
Following the web app's stock-info-screen.tsx structure exactly:

- Statistics cards below chart
- Events timeline with filtering
- Company info expandable section
- Ownership modal
- Executives modal
- Financials section

## Files to Create/Modify
1. `StockDetailScreen.tsx` - Complete implementation
